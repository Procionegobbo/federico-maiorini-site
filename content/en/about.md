- built full-stack solutions for large clients, mainly in the pharmaceutical sector  
- worked in both public and corporate environments using LAMP, .NET, SharePoint, C#, Angular, Oracle, and more

### 🎲 Game master, writer, worldbuilder

Since **1985**, I’ve been a passionate **game master**, storyteller, and creator of imaginary worlds. I’ve written and run countless campaigns like the mythos surrounding **Portanus**, a dark and ancient deity born from my love for archaeology, history, and mystery.

I also use role-playing as a team-building tool in the workplace — to foster creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving.
