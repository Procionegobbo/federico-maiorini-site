👋 Hi!  
I'm **Federico Maiorini**, a backend developer with over 15 years of experience, specialized in **Laravel**, **PHP**, and custom solutions for complex platforms. I currently work as a **Senior Developer at [Fitprime Labs](https://labs.fitprime.com/)**, focusing on robust architectures, REST APIs, OAuth2 authentication, and backend performance.

In my spare time, I’m also a **game master since 1985**, amateur writer, and obsessive world-builder. I create and explore narrative projects like *Storie di Ghainar* and RPG campaigns rooted in dark mythologies and mysterious settings.
