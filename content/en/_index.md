👋 Hi there!  
I'm **Federico Maiorini**, a backend developer with over 15 years of experience, specialized in **Laravel**, **PHP**, and custom-made architectures for complex platforms. I currently work as a **Senior Developer at Fitprime Labs**, focusing on robust systems, REST APIs, OAuth2 authentication, and backend performance.

In my free time, I'm also a **game master since 1985**, an amateur writer, and an obsessive world-builder. I create and explore narrative projects such as *Storie di Ghainar* and RPG campaigns based on original mythologies and darker settings.
